💡 Key Business Insights
	•	YouTube, Google, and Instagram are the strongest acquisition channels.
	•	Premium plans are most popular among users aged 26–45, indicating higher willingness to pay in mid-career segments.
	•	Younger users (18–25) tend to select Basic plans, reflecting price sensitivity.
	•	Pro plan users are the most likely to contact support, suggesting higher complexity or onboarding friction.
	•	Marketing opt-in behavior is consistent across age and gender, indicating that message relevance matters more than demographics.
	•	Missing and inconsistent data (e.g., region, plan names, age values) pose a risk to accurate reporting and modeling.
